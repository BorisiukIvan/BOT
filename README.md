# About

This is version 2.9 (written on 29 December 2022). This bot can:
- See checkmate in 1 move;
- See checkmate in 2 or 3 moves, if opponent has only one legal move;
- See capture;
- See if opponent can checkmate in 1 move;
- See if opponent can capture piece;

This bot cannot:
- Move by pawn for 2nd to 4th file;
- Castle;
- See if opponent can promote his pawn to queen;
- See primite fork;

And this bot doesn't know any openings, so don't be shocked if he moves 1. Na3 or Nh3 :)
